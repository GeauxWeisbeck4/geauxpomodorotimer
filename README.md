The Pomodoro (Pomodoro means tomato in Italian) Timer is a neat productivity tool that helps you work in sessions with short breaks, and after a certain number of runs, gives you a longer break. This was created based on the Pomodoro Technique, which breaks work up into four 25 minute sessions. After each
work session, you are given a short break of 5 minuts. After all four work sessions are complete, you get a longer break that ranges from 15 to thirty minutes. 

The theory behind this management method is that it reduces the number of internal and external workflow interruptions and allows you to get more work done than you would working for 5 minutes, then checking Facebook - another 5 minutes and then checking Twitter... you get the idea. If your activity gets interrupted, the activity must be recorded and postponed or the timer must be abandoned completely for the session.

This is only the first version of the Pomodoro Timer - here are future features that I plan to add in the near future:
# Add a "chore" to start the timer such as virtually winding the clock, solving a puzzle
# Adding a ticking sound of a mechanical timer
# Add a loud tomato squash sound effect to announce a break and the end of a break

The reason for these features are related to the Pomodoro Technique theory. The physical act of the user winding the timer or solving a puzzle to get started shows the user's determination for completing the task. Ticking externalizes the desire to complete the task, and ringing or squashing of the tomato announces a break. 

# Finishing Your Work Before the Timer Ends

If the user completes their work before the timer finishes, the user should:
    1. Review your work just completed.
    2. Review the activities from a learning point of view (ex: What learning objective did you accomplish? What learning outcome did you accomplish? Did        you fulfill your learning target, objective, or outcome for the task?)
    3. Review the list of upcoming tasks for the next planned pomodoro time blocks, and start reflecting on or updating them.

I learned how to make this from Angela Yu's Python Bootcamp Course I took a while ago. I went back and checked the code from that video to help me complete this when I got stuck. I faced challenges wiht getting the background to display correctly, having the timer digits display correctly, and setting up the checkmarks to show correctly. I was able to remember the rest of it as this was one of my favorite projects I completed in the past.
